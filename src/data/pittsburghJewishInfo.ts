ABOUT LEV ECHAD:
Lev Echad is a community organization founded by Shosh Mash, an Israeli mother, educator, and community builder. Seven years ago, they arrived in Pittsburgh with a baby, completely alone—without family, friends, or anyone to rely on. From that struggle grew a vision: to create a place where newcomers would immediately feel embraced, supported, and part of a community. Their mission is to turn loneliness into belonging and isolation into community.

Programs offered by Lev Echad:
- Weekly Shabbat Dinners: Intimate Friday night gatherings for connection and belonging
- Relocation Support: Help with housing, schools, summer camps, and navigating local systems
- Medical Treatment Support: Temporary housing, meals, and emotional companionship during medical emergencies
- Postpartum Support: Home-cooked Israeli meals delivered to new mothers
